    <h1>Hello World, it's me, Stephanie.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently a postdoctoral associate in MIT's Department of Architecture with the MIT-SUTD Collaboration. I am trained as an engineer, an architect, and a historian, and recently completed my PhD in MIT's History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art program. 

    During my PhD, I analyzed writings, transcripts, photographs, and drawings produced in the late nineteenth century France to examine a debate about the social utility of aesthetic experience in counteracting the perceived ills of the Industrial Revolution. I wrote many words and included reproductions of images in an appendix at the end of the dissertation, following conventions for knowledge production in the humanities that date back to the nineteeth century.

    Now, as a side project, I want to try something new. Or at least new to me. I want to examine new kinds of primary-source materials (known to those outside the humanities as "data") through new methodologies and present my findings in new forms. But in doing so, I want to return to my earlier training, rekindling my affinity for both quantititive methods and the visual/diagrammatic presentation of information. 

    Hence for the time being, this page will be my sandbox for data visualization experiments and exercises. I want to create visualizations underlied by rigorous, systemmatic, and critical thought. On the other hand, it is also my goal not to crash your browser. And above all I want to have fun and enjoy the process of learning.</p>
